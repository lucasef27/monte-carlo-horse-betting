# Monte Carlo Horse Betting
Monte Carlo Horse Betting — simulate horse race outcomes and betting strategies to estimate expected returns and risk metrics.

**Monte Carlo simulator for horse-race betting** — run stochastic simulations of races and betting strategies to estimate expected returns, variance, and risk metrics.

## Overview
This repository provides tools to:
- Simulate horse race outcomes using probabilistic models.
- Visualize simulation results and compare strategies.

## Why Monte Carlo?
Monte Carlo lets you approximate the distribution of outcomes by repeatedly simulating random races under a chosen model (e.g., probability vectors derived from odds). It helps evaluate how a betting strategy performs under variability and tail events.
